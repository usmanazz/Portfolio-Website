  teams to implement/optimize features.`,
  difficulty: `With COVID-19, everything was remote and it was difficult for us as a team to have constant communication
  and recieve instant feedback on my code. In addition, since it was my first time in mobile devlopment, there was a considerable
  learning curve the mentorship I would have potentially acquired if in person.`,
  solution: `To solve the communication issue, I made sure to be active on our discord and reached out to individual teams members
  that could help address any problems or questions I had. I was in constant contact with the Product Manager to ensure I was making the
  decisions and on track to complete my tasks. To address the learning curve issue, I asked team members for the best resources to learn
  the various technologies and took down useful notes to refer back to.`,

  Have a better understanding of how design, frontend, and backend come together to create complex web systems.`,
  difficulty: `It was difficult to find a suitable method to implement pagination in the search results page to prevent displaying 
  too many recipes at once. Tried to integrate a third-party Wizard component with no success.`,
  solution: `To incorporate pagination in the results page, I implemented a series of functions to slice the list of recipes obtained from
  the API and incremented a next page counter to indicate the next set of recipes in the list to display. Used a load more button rather
  than page numbers for a more simple and elegant UI experience.`,

  levelâ€™s exit(s), then head through an exit to advance to the next level of the building. Kill zombies with fire or mines to earn points.
  Once you have saved all of the citizens from every level, the game is over. Implemented in C++. Utilized Object Oriented Programming
  principles, STL, Data Structures.`,
  technologies: ["C++", "Visual Studio Code", "Object Oriented Design"],
  whatILearned: `This was developed as a school project and my first large-scale project (1000+ lines of code) that someone, even with 
  limited computer experience, could use.`,
  difficulty: `Since there are so many objects to keep track of throughout the game, (player, dumb zombie, smart zombie, citizens, lives,
    utility such as flames and mines, vaccines to get additional life, pits, walls, exit(s), etc) it was difficult to design the overall
    class structure of entire game.`,
  solution: `To solve this struggle, I put a lot more time into designing the project rather than jumping right into the code.
    I mapped out relationships between various objects (i.e. citizens, dumb zombies, and smart zombies are all Persons but citizens
    are NOT zombies) and once I had a comprehensive design layout in place, I incrementally implemented the various base
    and derived classes.`,

  whatILearned: `On top of getting more experience developing with React Native and overall front end technologies, I learned about 
  state management. The benefit of using a state library like MobX was that it took care of re-rendering the app on state change,
  I was able to create multiple stores to separate state of unrelated features, and overall write more maintainable code.`,
  difficulty: `One of the difficulties of creating the UI to track the sets and reps of each exercise was how to represent the data 
  so that it could display whether the user has started a set as well as storing this info in the user's workout history.`,
  solution: `To address this issue, instead of storing the sets as a list of strings, I created a list of objects where each object 
  stores the number of reps the user completed and a state property to keep track of whether or not the set was started. This ensures
  a clean and simple UI at the cost of some additional preprocessing to update state on user interaction.`,

  whatILearned: `This project was a great introduction to utilizing more complex data structures to avoid duplicate work and achieve 
  more efficient code. I created a trie data structure to store DNA sequences and quickly extract subsquences that match user input.
  In addition, I got more experience in Object Oriented Design and manipulating common STL containers/Data Structures.`,
  difficulty: `I had a hard time implementing a function to find subsquences in the trie data structure that were SNiPs of the passed in 
  DNA. A SNiP is a sequence that differs from another sequence by only 1 DNA base.`,
  solution: `My solution was to create an algorithm that loops through the sequence and replaces 1 character in the string at each 
  iteration with a character that exists in the trie and checks if the modified string is stored in the trie.`,
